# NANOPORE DIRECT RNA SEQUENCING – LAB WORKFLOW SUMMARY

Unlike the Illumina sequencing platform for transcriptomics, the Nanopore Direct RNA sequencing approach does not require reversed transcription to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA), and fragmentation. Long reads of full-transcripts can be obtained from the native RNA molecules in the sample. The main thing that can limit the length of your reads is poor sample handling that can unintentionally degrade or fragment the RNA.

Notice from the protocol, that we will be performing a reverse-transcription step. This is not required but recommended. The pores in the array will only read the RNA strand. By generating the first-strand of cDNA, we will be able to facilitate passage of the RNA strand through the pore, and to improve the accuracy and throughput of the reads.

Our lab workflow will follow these steps:
1. Brain RNA isolation & quantification of RNA
2. Reverse-transcription of the first-strand of cDNA
3. Adapters ligation
4. Two clean-up steps
5. Preparation of the RNA library for loading
6. Priming & loading the flow cell
